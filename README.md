# EEGraph

### Compilation

`$ mkdir build`

`$ cmake ..`

`$ make`

### Run executable examples

`$ sssp --help`

`$ sssp --input <filename>`

### Input graph format

Input graphs should be in form of plain text files, containing the list of the edges of the graph. Each line is corresponding to an edge and is of the following form:

```
V1  V2  W
```
